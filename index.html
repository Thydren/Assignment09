    <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h1>
    <p>9 week classes are always a pain and stressful especially for someone like me who likes to push my luck to the last minute. Taking breaks helped me a lot and talking to my friends who are in jobs like this helped motivate me to just keep going.</p>
    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>Not sure what to put here. I guess keep the students close together instead of spread out. That should help people ask their peers for help, which should help you, the teacher, see if the students are actually getting this.</p>
    <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
    <p>I knew some HTML and no CSS. Class is ending and I'm still at the same level as before. Well...maybe I know a little more with the whole github/git.</p>
    <h2>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h2>
    <p>Concepts that were new to me were Git/Github. Concepts that I have encountered was when I was learning HTML span and div flew over my head, but this time I kind of get it.</p>
